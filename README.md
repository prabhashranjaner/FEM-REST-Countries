## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- TypeScript
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Styled Components](https://styled-components.com/) - For styles
- React-Query
- ContextAPi - For Theme
- React-Router - For Routing

### What I learned

> React-query: While making this I used React-Query to make query. Before I used to use useEffect for the same thing. I am still new to this.

Small Trick I learned from [https://css-tricks.com/emoji-as-a-favicon/] to use emoji as Favicon.

```

### Continued development

- Need More practice of TypeScript, Styled Componet & React Query
- Still not comfortable with CSS Grid
